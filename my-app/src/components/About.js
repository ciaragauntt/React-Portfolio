                    I recently graduated from the Trilogy Coding Bootcamp at the <br/>
                    University of Utah. With no prior knowledge of coding, I have<br/>
                    been able to quickly learn all the tools and skills required <br/>
                    to be a full stack software developer. Throughout this website <br/>
                    you will see how much I have learned and what I am capable of <br/>
                    as a software developer.
