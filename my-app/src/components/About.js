                    I recently graduated from the Trilogy Coding Bootcamp at the <br/>
                    University of Utah. With no prior knowledge of coding, I have<br/>
                    been able to quickly learn all the tools and skills required <br/>
                    to be a full stack software developer. Below you will see some<br/>
                    major projects I have completed. Please reach out if you have<br/>
                    any questions!
